# ez-chat app
This is a chat app created to play with node and socket.io. Right now it's in a very primitive stage, but I'll be working on it a little bit. To try the app you can open different tabs and see how the chat messages are broadcasted to all the other tabs. You can also acces the app with your phone or any other device, and you'll see how the messages are also received there.

## Commits
Two emojis are used to describe te general purpose of the commits:

➕: Add/create/implement a new feature

🔄: Refactor/small update/fix existing features

🆕: Extra emoji that was used only in the first commit of the development

## Progress
- [x] Create the hello world
- [ ] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- [ ] Add support for nicknames
- [ ] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter
- [ ] Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- [ ] Show who’s online
- [ ] Add private messaging

This is the plan I'm following. This is basically the "Homework" from [Socket.io Getting started page](https://socket.io/get-started/chat#Homework). It looked really interesting so why not going for it!
